Some computations for Persistence Modules using GAP




# Install (develop)

1. Install [GAP](https://www.gap-system.org/) and its packages, which already includes [QPA](https://www.gap-system.org/Packages/qpa.html).

2. Locate/choose a pkg directory where GAP searches for packages. See 
   Section 9.2 "GAP Root Directories" of the GAP manual for more information.
   
   It can be any pkg/ subdirectory of one of the directories returned by running:
   ```
   gap> GAPInfo.RootPaths;
   ```
   in gap.
